{"name":"iOS Overflow scrollToTop","tagline":"Replacement for missing scrollToTop of -webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;","body":"# iOS Overflow ScrollToTop\r\nUsing `-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch` provides native-like scrolling on iOS web apps. However, when using it on any element other than `document.body`, it will break the native *scroll-to-top* behavior when tapping the status bar. This tiny script provides a replacement that even works when the scrollarea is currently bouncing or in momentum / inertia.\r\n\r\nCheck the [demo](http://prud.github.io/ios-overflow-scroll-to-top/demo/) on your iOS device (short: [goo.gl/6HJ9oG](http://goo.gl/6HJ9oG)). Scroll down and tap the header to scroll up.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n    headerEl.addEventListener('click', function() {\r\n      window.scrollToTop(contentEl);\r\n    });\r\n`contentElement` can be a DOM element or a CSS-like selector.\r\n\r\n## Compatibility\r\nThe script should work on all iOS 5+ devices (both browser and UIWebView). The [demo](http://prud.github.io/ios-overflow-scroll-to-top/demo/) has been tested on:\r\n\r\n- iPhone 5 (iOS 6)\r\n- iPod Touch (4th gen, iOS 6)\r\n- iPhone Simulator (iOS 5-7)\r\n- both on Mobile Safari and within UIWebview (e.g. [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) or [Trigger.io](http://trigger.io))\r\n\r\n## Known issues\r\n#### Why won't it scroll to top when I tap the status bar?\r\nIf you're building a web app for Mobile Safari it is not possible to listen for events on the status bar. However, if you're working with a UIWebView, you can actually achieve this with some native code.
